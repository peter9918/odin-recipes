  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol class="long-text">
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      Coat 2 pie plates with non-stick cooking spray.
    </li>
    <li>Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat.
      Cook until beef is evenly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
      Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried beans.
      Spread 1/2 of the seasoned ground beef over each one, and then cover with a second tortilla.
      Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas are crisp, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly.
      Then spread 1/2 of the salsa over each top tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes,
      1/2 of the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.
    </li>
    <li>Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10 more minutes.
      Let pizzas cool slightly before slicing each one into 4 pieces.
    </li>
  </ol>
